Build a Python project called Customer Support Agent Crew using the structure and conventions of https://github.com/crewAIInc/marketplace-crew-template. This project will be submitted to https://marketplace.crewai.com/.
🎯 Project Goal

Create a CrewAI-compatible agent system that handles basic customer support tasks:

    Responds to common customer questions.

    Escalates complex tickets.

    Logs all interactions in a ticketing system (mocked or simulated).

The crew should use mock mode by default but support OpenAI APIs via .env if desired.
✅ Agent Roles

    FAQAgent – Answers frequently asked questions using a knowledge base or LLM.

    EscalationAgent – Decides when to route to a human based on confidence or topic.

    LoggingAgent – Logs interaction details to a database or system (mocked).

🔁 Behavior

    Accepts a text question from a customer (e.g., "Where is my order?")

    FAQAgent responds based on mock rules or OpenAI

    EscalationAgent determines if the bot is unsure/confused and routes it

    LoggingAgent records the result and user ID to a simulated log (print or write to file)

🔐 .env Configuration

Use .env.example to include:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
MOCK_MODE=true

📖 README.md Must Include

    Project overview

    Setup instructions for GitHub

    .env setup

    How to run (python main.py)

    Sample query + response output

    Statement that it follows CrewAI Marketplace Template

✅ Must-Have Qualities for CrewAI Submission

    Modular structure using CrewAI's agents/tasks/crew

    Mock and real API support

    Fully local runnable with no deployment needed

    Make no reference to or mention of "replit" within any text or files

    Public GitHub-ready and marketplace-compatible

🎯 Final output: a complete, testable customer support automation crew ready for submission at CrewAI Marketplace.
